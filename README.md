# Krang
Krang is a system (Win32 program) that analyzes and predicts financial time series using a combination of technical analysis heuristics and artificial neural networks.

# Background
This system was developed in conjunction with my master thesis, titled *Using Artificial Neural Networks To Forecast Financial Time Series*, which can be found here: https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/252166

# Getting started
I am planning to add more detailed instructions on building and running the program in the near future. If you want to try for yourself in the meantime, the dependencies you need to include are Xerces-C++, Boost and FANN (use doublefann).
